PRODIGY INTERNSHIP - CYBER SECURITY  

I would like to express my gratitude to Prodigy Infotech for providing me with the opportunity to work on these projects and for the invaluable support and guidance throughout my internship journey. Here is my approach on the tasks provided to me: 

TASK 1: IMPLEMENT CAESAR CIPHER 
        Created a Python-based Caesar Cipher tool that can both encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting characters according to a user-defined key.

TASK 2: PIXEL MANIPULATION FOR IMAGE ENCRYPTION 
         In this program, basic mathematical operation (XOR) are used to encrypt and decrypt the image.
         
TASK 3: PASSWORD COMPLEXITY CHECKER
         Password Complexity Checker Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length,
         presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

TASK 4: SIMPLE KEYLOGGER
        A basic keylogger program developed using Python! 
        This tool records and logs keystrokes, with a focus on capturing key inputs and saving them to a file.
