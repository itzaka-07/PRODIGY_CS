PRODIGY INTERNSHIP - CYBER SECURITY  

I would like to express my gratitude to Prodigy Infotech for providing me with the opportunity to work on these projects and for the invaluable support and guidance throughout my internship journey. Here is my approach on the tasks provided to me: 

TASK 1: IMPLEMENT CAESAR CIPHER 
        LEARN ABOUT THE CAESAR CIPHER ENCRYTION DECRYPTION TECHNIQUE AND IT'S USE IN EARLIER TIMES.
        IMPLEMENTED A PYTHON CODE FOR THE TASK.

TASK 2: PIXEL MANIPULATION FOR IMAGE ENCRYPTION 
         In this program, basic mathematical operation (XOR) are used to encrypt and decrypt the image.
